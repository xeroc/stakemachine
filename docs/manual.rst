Manual Configuration
====================

The configuration of ``dexbot`` internally happens through a YAML formatted
file. Unless you are developing or want to use a custom strategy, you don't
need to edit this.

The default
file name is ``config.yml``, and ``dexbot`` only seeks the file in the current directory.

Otherwise you can specify a different
config file using the ``--configfile X`` parameter when calling ``dexbot run``.

The config.yml file
-------------------


.. code-block:: yaml

    # The BitShares endpoint to talk to
    node: "wss://node.testnet.bitshares.eu"

    # List of bots
    bots:

        # Name of the bot. This is mostly for logging and internal
        # use to distinguish different bots
        NAME_OF_BOT:

            # Python module to look for the strategy (can be custom)
	    # dexbot will search in ~/bots as well as standard dirs
	    module: "dexbot.strategies.echo"

            # The bot class in that module to use
            bot: Echo

            # The market to subscribe to
            market: GOLD:TEST

            # The account to use for this bot
            account: xeroc

            # Custom bot configuration
            foo: bar

Using the configuration in custom strategies
--------------------------------------------

The bot's configuration is available to in each strategy as dictionary
in ``self.bot``. The whole configuration is avaialable in
``self.config``. The name of your bot can be found in ``self.name``.
