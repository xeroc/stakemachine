        Replace <strategy_name> with the name of the strategy.

        This is a template strategy which can be used to create custom strategies easier. The base for the strategy is
        ready. It is recommended comment the strategy and functions to help other developers to make changes.

        Adding strategy to GUI
        In dexbot.controller.worker_controller add new strategy inside strategies() as show below:

            strategies['dexbot.strategies.strategy_template'] = {
                'name': '<strategy_name>',
                'form_module': ''

            key: Strategy location in the project
            name: The name that is shown in the GUI for user
            form_module: If there is custom form module created with QTDesigner

        Adding strategy to CLI
        In dexbot.cli_conf add strategy in to the STRATEGIES list

            {'tag': 'strategy_temp',
             'class': 'dexbot.strategies.strategy_template',
             'name': 'Template Strategy'},

        NOTE: Change this comment section to describe the strategy.

            This method contains the strategy's logic. Keeping this function as simple as possible is recommended.

            Note: All orders are "buy" orders, since they are flipped to be easier to handle. Keep them separated to
            avoid confusion on problems.

            Placing an order to the market has been made simple. Placing a buy order for example requires two values:
            Amount (as QUOTE asset) and price (which is BASE amount divided by QUOTE amount)

            "Placing to buy 100 ASSET_A with price of 10 ASSET_A / ASSET_B" would be place_market_buy_order(100, 10).
            This would then cost 1000 USD to fulfil.
