Dexbot database migrations are handled by alembic. See https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/

## Create new migration

```
alembic revision -m "Short summary of changes"
```

Next, modify the migration script in dexbot/migrations/versions/

Migration will be applied automatically on next run of dexbot, see `run_migrations()` in dexbot/storage.py

Don't forget to change table definitions in dexbot/storage.py.
